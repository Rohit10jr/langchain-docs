    "Many AI applications interact directly with humans. In these cases, it is appropriate for models to respond in natural language. But what about cases where we want a model to also interact directly with systems, such as databases or an API? These systems often have a particular input schema; for example, APIs frequently have a required payload structure. This need motivates the concept of tool calling. You can use tool calling to request model responses that match a particular schema."

    "3. Tool Calling: When appropriate, the model can decide to call a tool and ensure its response conforms to the tool's input schema. \n",
